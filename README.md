Hi there!
Have you ever gotten the feeling when your Opera GX mod just needs that tiny change but you need to reupload the whole thing?
Way too often...
So to make it easier, i've made a bat file you can run, that automatically compresses your mod so you can just execute it and have your mod compressed, named with your version specified in the manifest.json!
Ain't that easy?


Usage:
All you have to do is run the file in the folder ABOVE YOUR MOD'S ROOT FOLDER, and rename your mod folder to "current"
